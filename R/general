Relational Operators:
(can be applied to scalars and vectors, lists, and matricies as well)
TRUE == TRUE         will yield TRUE
TRUE != FALSE        will yield TRUE
"H"  >= "G"          will yield TRUE
TRUE <= FALSE        will yield FALSE

AND &           (note, &&, || and  only compares 1st element in structures)
OR  |
NOT !  !TRUE    will yield FALSE



is.numeric(5)


# will exit If structure as soon as something is true
if(condition){
  expr
} else if {
  exp2
} else  {
  exp3
}

# can be stopped with a break statement
while(ctr <= 10) {
   expr
   ctr <- ctr+1
}

#seq can be vector , list  (matricies , dataframes)
# break    also works ending for loop ,  
# next     will skip following commands, but continue for loop
for(var in seq) {
  exp
}

# to loop over the index in a list/vector:
for (i in 1:length(cities)) {        # 1:6==c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
   print(cities[i])
}
